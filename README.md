# exploit-bad-characters
A small Python class to generate all hex characters with the ability to define bad ones. It can also generate the grid of hex characters you would expect to see in the debugger/inspector, and print outb the ASCII version of the bad characters so you can see why they failed.


## Usage

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import badcharacters

chars = badcharacters.Chars()

# Define your bad characters
chars.badChars = ['0a', '0d']

# Get a list of all characters, excluding the ones you have marked above
allChars = chars.getCharsExceptBad()

# (optional) Print out some helpers
print "You are excluding the following characters : " + chars.getConvertedBadChars() + "\n"
print "Hex should equal the grid below\n"
print chars.getHexGrid()

# You should recognise this bit and just include your characters from above ........
codeBuffer = "A" * 2606 + "B" * 4 + allChars
```

This will output the following. Having the grid helps when a character is missing as the end of hte rows won't match!

```bash
You are excluding the following characters : '\n  \r  '

Hex should equal the grid below

## Notes
The badcharacter.py file would need to be in the same directory as your script so you can import it. Alternately it could go in any folder in the python sys.path. 

I put mine in a folder related to oscp `/root/oscp/modules` and then added that folder globally by updating the file `/root/.bashrc` to add this at the bottom

```
export PYTHONPATH='/root/oscp/modules/'
```
If you edit that file, you will need to reboot your kali machine, or source the file `source /root/.bashrc`.

I've built a few modules to help with various exploits so it's much easier to have alll of those available as imports.
